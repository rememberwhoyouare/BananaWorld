# BananaWorld

## Intro

This README is meant to demonstrate completion of the non-code portions of the project, as described in Part 1 of the Instructions. This section was written entirely by Anthony Summerville. For a better idea of what the group as a whole was up to, visit `pdf/brainstorm.pdf`

## Purpose of Website

The website's purpose is to inform and entice customers about our theme park, Banana Land. This means that our primary stakeholders are going to be customers, which
are comprised of:
- kids approx. 7+ years old
- their parents
- adults who are already big fans of the Banana Cinematic Universe

as well as the theme park and company executives, who want a website that is representative of the established brand and brings in more ticket sales.

## Analysis of Web Sites / Content Identification

Some of the websites we reviewed are:
- https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/
- https://disneyland.disney.go.com/
- https://www.sixflags.com/
- https://www.universalorlando.com/
- https://seaworld.com/

The common theme among all of these is that they start with a large, full-width banner that shows a sort of panorama of the theme park. Then shortly below it are a list of attractions and/or parks of the same brand(if applicable) followed by a button to purchase tickets, as well as any special deals or sales that are going on at the moment. The ticket purchase pipeline is fairly straightforward - you select the type of ticket, the time for which the ticket is valid, and any other amenities such as Disney's FastPass and the like.
